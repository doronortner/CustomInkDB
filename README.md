# CustomInkDB

This project was the main project of Databases course I took during my 2nd year.
I had to analyze and create the DB of an actual website (customink.com) in order to support various business processes using SQL.
I used several advanced SQL tools such as window fucntions, stored procedures, triggers, nested queries and more.
In addition I produced different types of operative and management reports using PowerBI.
